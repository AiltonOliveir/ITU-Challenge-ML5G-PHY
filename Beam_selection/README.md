# ITU-Challenge-ML5G-PHY
Baseline implementations for the  “Machine Learning Applied to the Physical Layer of Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems” (ML5G-PHY), which is part of the “ITU AI/ML 5G Challenge"

Details about the challenge and the datasets are avaiable at http://ai5gchallenge.ufpa.br/ and https://www.lasse.ufpa.br/raymobtime/, respectively.

To generate neural network files, see the documentation in the processing directories.

To run the neural network after already had the files, run the following command:

```bash
python classifierTopKBeams.py
```

It is assumed that **Python 3** is used
